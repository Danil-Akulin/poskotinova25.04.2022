<p> In 2004, Airbus set about piecing together parts of what they hoped would become the largest passenger plane in the skies. Pieces were shipped from Toulouse to the assembly site in Hamburg. As the pieces were moved closer together, it soon became clear that they didn’t fit.

We later learned that designers working on the parts of the plane had been using a different CAD programmes which meant that the measurements were all different.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Why the project failed </h2>
<p>failed due to the fact that the waterfall system was used, which was not fully developed, namely, it was not indicated in which program the work with the aircraft parts should be performed, which led to a mismatch in the size of the parts due to a different number system. This project failed completely. </p>
